# SRPC
Which stands either for Shitty RPC or for Schizophrenia RPC. Whatever you prefer.

Please never ever use this terrible piece of underqualified engeneering. It was
written out of hopelessness by a person who never touched erlang in his life
and just wanted some protobufs really badly...

The only good thing about it is that it is abstracted enough so that it can be
rewritten relatively easily without changing code that already depends on it
that much.
